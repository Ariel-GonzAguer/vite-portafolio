**Holas**\
This repository is dedicated to my personal portfolio. It is made with React + Vite and deployed in [Netlify](https://app.netlify.com/).
For the general icons I used the [FontAwsome](https://fontawesome.com/) library, for the internal navigation I used React Router.\
Other libraries used are:
- [Sonner](https://sonner.emilkowal.ski/) for the nice and simple design change notification.
- [Redux TLK ](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/) for a little state management.

I appreciate any constructive criticism or suggestion ðŸŒŸ
