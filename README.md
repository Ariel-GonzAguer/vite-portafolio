# Arie GonzAgüer Portpholio

**Holas**\
This repository is dedicated to my personal portfolio. It is made with React + Vite and deployed in [Netlify](https://app.netlify.com/).
For the general icons I used the [FontAwsome](https://fontawesome.com/) library, for the internal navigation I used React Router.\
Other libraries used are:
- [Sonner](https://sonner.emilkowal.ski/) for the nice and simple design change notification.
- [Redux TLK](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/) for the state management.
- [Mocha](https://https://mochajs.org/) and [Chai](https://www.chaijs.com/) for some testing.
- [EmailJS](https://www.emailjs.com/) for the contact form.

I appreciate any constructive criticism or suggestion 🌟


## Features
Choose a style for the homepage!\
I want to show some of my creativity in the design part of the web development, so the user can see the homepage in these styles/modes:
- Neumorphism -> clean and soft.
- Dark -> classic and simple.
- Light -> colors everywhere!
- Neubrutalism -> impactful and bold.


## Tech Stack
- React.
- Vite.
- Redux TLK.
- React Router DOM.

## Next Steps
- Add a Redux slice to save in the local storage the user's favorite articles.
- Clean de CSS styles.
- Invite other devs to write some articles.
- Add more test.
