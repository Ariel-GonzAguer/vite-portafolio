        <p>I would like to tell you a little more about who I am.<br />
          After several years as a professional brewer, winning medals at a local and international level, always focused on meeting objectives and extreme cleanliness in my processes, I wanted to look for new directions for my creativity and desire to help other people, and that is how I found the web development, becoming a new joy.<br /><br />
          I love creating neat, creative and super user-friendly projects, always keeping in mind accessibility, clean design and good practices when writing code.<br />
          I have been studying this new Front End Development Engineering career at <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/" target="_blank">CodeCademy</a>  for approximately 15 months, and currently (22 september, 2024) I am learning/working with Asymptotic Notation and Algorithms to take the performance to next level!<br /><br />

          I have basic knowledge of unit testing with Jest, Mocha and React-Testing-Library, I use Git Bash without problems when creating projects and uploading them to Github, I also know how to work with third-parties APIs, and I'm learning more about Authentication. In addition to the above, I have obtained certificates in Design Thinking, Emojicode, Interaction Design, Open Source, UI & UX Design and User Research. Parallel to my education as a Web Developer, I have also certified myself as a Lean Six Sigma White Belt and Remote Work Professional Certification.
