          I would like to tell you a little more about who I am.
          <br />
          After several years as a professional brewer, winning medals at a
          local and international level, always focused on meeting objectives
          and extreme cleanliness in my processes, I wanted to look for new
          directions for my creativity and desire to help other people, and that
          is how I found the web development, becoming a new joy.
          <br />
          <br />
          I love creating minimalist, neat, creative and super user-friendly
          projects, always keeping in mind accessibility, clean design and good
          practices when writing code.
