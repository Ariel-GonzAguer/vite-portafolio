    It is a fictitious ( ðŸ˜¿ ) vegan burger joint. The page contains a small and delicious menu in the form of a slider and the description of the most important ingredients. In addition, users can place their order from the page. When placing the order, people have the option to read/use a detailed guide on how to place their order, this to provide more accessibility to the project.\n\The project has a lot to improve, and it will do so in the near future, but in the meantime you can see it here: `,

    For this project I used the Reddit API, React, Redux TLK, React Router, and OAuth 2.0. The app allows users to view and search posts provided by the API, and features a section for popular subreddits. The design is simple and clean, with a color scheme that plays off of the Reddit logo.\n\
    Next steps:\n\
    > show a modal with more information when clicking on the posts.\n\
    > add a dark mode.\n\
