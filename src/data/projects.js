    It is a fictitious ( ðŸ˜¿ ) vegan burger joint. The page contains a small and delicious menu in the form of a slider and the description of the most important ingredients. In addition, users can place their order from the page. When placing the order, people have the option to read/use a detailed guide on how to place their order, this to provide more accessibility to the project.\n\The project has a lot to improve, and it will do so in the near future, but in the meantime you can see it here: `,

    For this project I used the Reddit API, React, Redux TLK, React Router, and OAuth 2.0. The app allows users to view and search posts provided by the API, and features a section for popular subreddits. The design is simple and clean, with a color scheme that plays off of the Reddit logo.\n\
    Next steps:\n\
    > show a modal with more information when clicking on the posts.\n\
    > add a dark mode.\n\

    With this web app users can create their own Kitty Cat Card Collection!\n\You can create cards similar to other card games like Pokemon, but Cat based.
    Take a screenshot and share it with your friends ðŸ˜º\n\The card is only yours ðŸ˜¼\n\Made with React, React Router, Redux TLK, this web app is designed to be used on mobile devices, it also uses third-party APIs and ventures into the use of the user's device's Local Storage to save cards created with images from third-party APIs.cUsers can choose everything from the name of the Kitty, the points of each attribute, to the image of your card.\n\Try it out and tell me what you think!`,

I can now keep track of the time separately for the boiling pasta and the seitan I'm baking!\n\At the moment the app requires an internet connection to use, but I plan to offer an equal (or slightly simpler, depending on the possibilities offered by technology) option that works offline.\n\It has two design options: Neumorphism and Neobrutalism.\n\Try it here:`,
